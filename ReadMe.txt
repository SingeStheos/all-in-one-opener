First Start Guide:
	
	Open the software and pick associations to file types, like .jpg and .gif.
	When you have a file to open, drag and drop into AIOO and it will display a clarification (like 
	with Gamebryo .nif where different methods were used for different Bethesda games.) if needed,
	then will open a preview. From here, you can convert it to another format, but it must stay within
	the output type (2D, 3D, Text) unless going from 3D to 2D in form of a render or 2D to text in the
	form of an ASCII render.
